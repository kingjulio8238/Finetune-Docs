Developers will also be able to easily import the graph for extra fine-tuning or feedback.

Enter a feedback session and our agent will propose these bad executions that failed to meet the synthetic user's with necessary context and easily respond back with your feedback.  </p>"},{"location":"core-concepts/feedback-session/finetunes-agent/#aligning-to-your-core-values","title":"Aligning to your core values","text":"<p> We use this human feedback to update your execution graph with additional context - think community notes.

One of these attributes is  misson  which defines the ideal outcome the user wants from the interaction with the user.   For each interaction we track the task list (generated by the LLM) that your agent executed and the outcome. We use this information to grade its outcome against the user's mission statement. If the ideal outcome is achieved, we will add positive weights to the execution graph and visa versa if the outcome didn't go quite as planned.  </p> <p> At the end of the fine-tuning session you'll receive the weighted execution graph with all these weights added ready for deployment to your private cloud :)  </p>"},{"location":"core-concepts/fine-tuning-session/running-agent-against-users/","title":"Running agent against users","text":"<p> Once you have entered a fine-tuning session and we have created your syntethic users, we will initialize a sandbox environment where your agent will run against each syntethic user covering all their questions.

We believe that all data related to your agents' executions, weights, and feedback should be kept private and secure.  </p> <p> That is why we are creating an easy way for developers to deploy and store your weighted execution graph in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Developers can also easily import the graph for additional fine-tuning or feedback.  </p> <p> Finetune will integrate with multiple cloud providers, allowing you to choose the one that best suits your needs.

We will focus on the former here.   Finetune has developed an in-house multi-agent system to identify which executions received a negative weight during the fine-tuning session. When you enter a feedback session, our agent will propose these executions with the necessary context.

One of these attributes is  mission , which defines the user's ideal outcome from interacting with the agent.   For each interaction, we track the task list (LLM-generated) that your agent executed and the outcome. We use this information to judge the outcome against the user's mission. If the agent achieves the ideal outcome and the user is satisfied, we will add positive weights to the execution graph, and vice versa if the outcome doesn't go as planned.  </p> <p> At the end of the fine-tuning session, you'll receive the weighted execution graph with all these weights added, ready for deployment to your private cloud :)  </p>"},{"location":"core-concepts/fine-tuning-session/running-agent-against-users/","title":"Running agent against users","text":"<p> Once you have entered a fine-tuning session and have access to the synthetic users, we will initialize a sandbox environment, available in the Finetune Console, that tracks your agents' logs after running against each synthetic user, covering all their questions.
